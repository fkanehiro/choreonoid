This is a test version of the plugin for introducing the AgX Dynamics library released by algoryx.

How to use AgXPlugin:

1. Install AgX Dynamics

For Ubuntu Linux, AgX can be installed by using the dpkg command like:

 sudo dpkg -i agx-setup-2.13.2.2-x64-Ubuntu-double.deb

2. Copy the license file to the AgX directory

AgX is installed into /opt/Algoryx/AgX-x.y.z.2.
Copy the license file to this directory.

3. Set the environment variables

The setup_env.bash script is in the AgX directory.
Add the command to execute the script to the .profile file like:

 source /opt/Algoryx/AgX-2.13.2.2/setup_env.bash

You can immediately update the environment variables by executing:

 source ~/.profile

4. Compile AgXPlugin

You can compile AgXPlugin by enabling BUILD_AGX_PLUGIN In CMake.

5. Test AgX by using sample projects

Sample projects such as SR1Walk.cnoid include AgXSimulatorItem.
The item becomes available when AgXPlugin is loaded.
Select the item and execute the simulation, then the simulation is performed using AgX.

Note:
Some libraries used in AgX seem to conflict with those used in the Bullet physics library,
so AgXPlugin and BulletPlugin cannot be used simultaneously.
Please disable BulletPlugin when you use AgXPlugin.
